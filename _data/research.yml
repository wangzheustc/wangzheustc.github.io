      note: "We study the wisdom of including cryptocurrencies on the optimal portfolio choice of a risk averse investor. 
      We find that investors could gain additional utility from investing in cryptos as the optimal
      portfolio is less exposed to risks associated with macroeconomic shock, the stock market, and the bond
      market. If the investor has a higher degree of risk aversion, investing in cryptos will only reduce the risk
      exposure associated with the stock market. We conclude that cryptocurrencies improve the investable
      universe of assets and provide new channels/vehicles for investorsâ€™ risk hedging/diversification with no
      substitutes from the stock market."
