      title: "Should risk averse investors hold crypto currencies in their portfolio?"
      date: 2021-10-24
  #    pdf: "/download/papers/jmp.pdf"
      note: "I study the wisdom of including cryptocurrencies on the optimal portfolio choice of a risk averse investor. 
      I find that investors could gain additional utility from investing in cryptos as the optimal
      portfolio is less exposed to risks associated with macroeconomic shock, the stock market, and the bond
      market. If the investor has a higher degree of risk aversion, investing in cryptos will only reduce the risk
      exposure associated with the stock market. We conclude that cryptocurrencies improve the investable
      universe of assets and provide new channels/vehicles for investors’ risk hedging/diversification with no
      substitutes from the stock market."

      title: "The Risk-Return Relationship and Flight to Safety."
      date: 2021-11-17
      note: "The risk-return trade-off implies that a riskier investment should demand a higher expected return relative 
      to the risk-free return. The approach of Ghysels, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov (2005) consisted of estimating the risk-return 
      trade-off with a mixed frequency, or MIDAS, approach. MIDAS strikes a compromise between on the one hand the need for longer 
      horizons to model expected returns and on the other hand to use high frequency data to model the conditional volatility 
      required to estimate expected returns. Using the approach of Ghysels, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov (2005), we find that the Merton 
      model holds over samples that exclude financial crises, and show that a simple fight to safety indicator separates the traditional 
      risk-return relationship from financial crises."

      title: "The Real Effect of Disclosure on Company Decisions: Evidence from Portfolio Choices of Investment Companies."
      date: 2021-10-25
      note: "This paper investigates how the quality of financial disclosures impacts the portfolio choices of domestic and foreign 
      investment companies. I implement an exogenous shock to the quality of financial reporting in European equity markets and examine 
      the portfolio choices of global investment companies in the pre and post periods. I find that foreign investment companies significantly 
      improve their stock-picking skills after the shock, in contrast to domestic ones whose skills deteriorate afterward. The change in the 
      relative performance between domestic and foreign investment companies is more profound in stocks with larger information asymmetries, 
      and in stocks whose business complexity is more severe. My results contribute to the positive accounting theory by showing that the 
      aggregated information in financial disclosure could help investors making better investment decisions. However, to improve the disclosure 
      quality may not make all investors better off. Instead, the role financial reporting serves is to level the playing field between different 
      groups of investors. I thus provide direct evidence on how disclosure quality improves market efficiency and capital allocation."

      title: "Analyst Geographic Proximity to Industry Center, Industry Information, and the Efficacy of Analyst Research Output."
      date: 2021-10-25
      note: "We propose that an analyst’s distance-to-industry-center (DTIC) can serve as an instrument for industry information. Consistent with 
      this hypothesis, we find that DTIC has a significant negative impact on forecast accuracy. We conduct a series of tests to corroborate the 
      link between DTIC and industry information, which is relevant for within-industry co-movement of firm fundamentals and returns. Finally, we 
      exploit the impact of Chinese import shocks on different industries as exogenous shocks to industry centers to establish a causal link between 
      DTIC and forecast accuracy. Overall, we shed light on how an analyst’s industry information is disseminated into the market."

      title: "Bitcoin and News Around the World in Twenty-Six Languages."
      date: 2021-11-24
      note: "The question to what extend cryptocurrencies are different from other asset classes is a topic of keen interests to academics, 
      policy makers and practitioners. There is a large literature documenting the impact of U.S. macroeconomic news announcements on returns of 
      various financial markets. In comparison, far less is known about the impact of news on cryptocurrency markets. While in general it is not 
      clear what exactly determines the value of say Bitcoin, it is fair to say that one should not exclusively focus on macroeconomic events to 
      study impact of news on cryptocurrencies as many other events - including regulatory announcements - matter. We examine both traditional 
      news outlets as well as social media platforms. We use a unique and comprehensive data set to study the impact of news on Bitcoin. More 
      specifically, we use the Europe Media Monitor (EMM) data, which gathers and aggregates more than 300,000 news articles per day from news 
      portals world-wide in up to 70 languages -which we reduce to 26 for our analysis. It is this unique character of our data that allows us 
      to study the impact of news on Bitcoin beyond what has been considered so far in the literature."
